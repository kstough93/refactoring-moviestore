Synopsis

This is a quick-start for the "Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code", by Martin Fowler.  It contains the sample 
code from Chapter 1 along with a set of unit tests.

Motivation

I couldn't find a good starting set of code for the book so I decided to create it and share.  :)

Installation

Just clone the project.  I created this in Spring Tool Suite 3.8.2 on Eclipse Mars.2 (4.5.2)

Tests

The set of tests were built with JUnit.  This is a pretty short set of test, I'm sure more could be added to improve code
for those so inclined.
